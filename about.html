          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>I am beginner front-end developer, and I want to work on freelance. 
          </p>

          <p>I'm in  first-year students! I love that everyone is always willing to lend a helping hand no matter what and we're like one big family, which greatly helps propel not only our academic success, but social lives and happiness as well! 
        </p>
        <p>Actually, stepping out of my comfort zone and trying new things such as going out to school events really helped me find my place not only as a first year student, but as a member of google developer community</p>
